* write tri->leaf mapping and build list of triangles per leaf
* build bvh per node with some minimum of triangles per bvh
* build vertex buffer per node with also some mininum number of triangles
* for all lists (bvh/vb) maintain a bounding box of nodes in octree world
* simdify qem build and accumulation with double in sse
* make buildqem and buildedges asynchronous (be careful a part of buildedges
  depends on buildqem)
* annotate code where sse can be used
* handle properly rotation in csg evaluation
* build better sequence of union in csg tree to have something similar to a good
  bvh
* write a better class possibly refcouted for vertex buffer
* write more tests for tasking system
* generalized cvar to floating points and string possibly
* add m_* to make code more consistent accross the board
* be careful with all tasks and possibly refcount all structure
* build a lua interpreter as tool in the build
* write lua scripts to describe shaders rather than using macros hell
* removed unused shaders that are spread all over the place
* use regular font rendering instead of what is done today
* properly handle opengl version
* check problem when mouse is locked
* release all keys when getting ouf of focus
* improve naming (make it more consistent regarding '_')
* make sharpen mesh parallel to bvh building
* replace zlib by lz4+fse
* implement a simple fixed size hashmap for the mesh construction in geom.cpp
* other idea for mesh construction and hash map is to use a local hash map for
  all points that are going to be used *only* inside the given leaf
